## Overview

### Introduction

Fighting poverty, illiteracy and disease. Quality health care has been a distant dream since the days of our independence from the Colonial yoke. The dream is no longer distant with the numerous efforts from the government and humanitarian bodies to improve the health sector. With these improvements and increased access to health care services by our people, a new problem sets in: 

- How can we ensure that health records are handled with ease? 
- How can we manage health care data for the benefit of the people? 
- How can this data serve in the improvement of services by health care facilities? 
- How can new technology inclusive of IoT and AI be employed for the betterment of our people?

While some of these issues have been addressed, which has led to an enormous improvement in the health sector, a vital branch has been turned a blind eye upon. The maternal health sub-sector.

The Kenyan government under the umbrella of the Beyond Zero Campaign, spearheaded by her Excellency Margaret Kenyatta, has over the years addressed accessibility to property maternal health for our mothers and sisters. This has led to increased successfull live births and a considerable decrease in the number of deaths during childbirth.

### Overview
This is where our application comes in. An application that brings together major players in the maternal health sector. 
This includes health centers, health center departments, health practitioners, potential mothers, born babies, etc. With this integrationit is now possible for mobile availability of statistics in the health care sector.

This application does gathering of data for the betterment of the sector and through the analysis of this data, relevant entities are able to identify patterns in the data with specific emphasis on Africa as a continent. As much as we desire to adapt to the methodologies of the West in terms of medical care, it is important to identitfy the need for a custom health structure for Africa as a continent. It is through the adaptation of such a system that we are able to adapt reliably to the needs of our people.

The system is able to collect data during the entire period of a woman's pregnancy and even offer post-antenatal follow up. This is to eliminate the inherent high child mortality rates.
