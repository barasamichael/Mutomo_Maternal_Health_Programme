# Mutomo Maternal Health Programme

## Overview

### Introduction

Fighting poverty, illiteracy and disease. Quality health care has been a distant dream since the days of our independence from the Colonial yoke. The dream is no longer distant with the numerous efforts from the government and humanitarian bodies to improve the health sector. With these improvements and increased access to health care services by our people, a new problem sets in: 

- How can we ensure that health records are handled with ease? 
- How can we manage health care data for the benefit of the people? 
- How can this data serve in the improvement of services by health care facilities? 
- How can new technology inclusive of IoT and AI be employed for the betterment of our people?

While some of these issues have been addressed, which has led to an enormous improvement in the health sector, a vital branch has been turned a blind eye upon. The maternal health sub-sector.

The Kenyan government under the umbrella of the Beyond Zero Campaign, spearheaded by her Excellency Margaret Kenyatta, has over the years addressed accessibility to property maternal health for our mothers and sisters. This has led to increased successfull live births and a considerable decrease in the number of deaths during childbirth.
